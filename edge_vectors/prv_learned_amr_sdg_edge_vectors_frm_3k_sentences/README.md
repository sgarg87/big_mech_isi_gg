In addition to the learning module in the parent module, we have learned edge vectors for AMR and SDG using a dataset of 3k sentences (this dataset is not availed here). We provide these learned edge vectors in pickled files, and correspondingly also a module "edge_vectors.py" for obtaining vector for an edge in an AMR/SDG. Also, we evaluated cosine similarity between the learned edge vectors. The plots are provided in a subfolder "edge_vectors_similarity_plots_fr_AMR_SDG" in pdf format. These plots, if observed closely, justify our approach as we see correct similarities in semantic meaning of edge labels within AMR/SDG and across AMR/SDG.
