This module avails the pubmed45 datatset, that has been manually annotated by authors containing approx. 26k interactions (approx. 2k positive labels). This is the primary datset used in the paper. This dataset has been acknowledged an one of important contributions in the paper since there is no previous publicly available dataset that has information on interaction type of interaction proteins. Previous annotated datasets only has a pair of interacting proteins as an interaction unit. Our interaction representation is richer as explained in the paper. This is why we had to manually annoatate this dataset. Here it is important to note that the dataset DO NOT use any sort of distant supervision techniques for annoatation and comes from pure manual annotation by single person (Sahil Garg, later is important since there can be disagreements between annoators otherwise). Though, some smart internal tools were used for the manual annoatation. All of this is important since it is manually labeled datasets that are best suitable for tesing of an extraction/classification algorithm while one can should use distant supervised like datasets only for training purposes (using distant supervised datsets for testing can lead to inflated F1 scores).

For an estimation for futture annotators, annotation speed was approx. 200 interactions per hour. So, its approx. 130 hours to annotate (15 days).
